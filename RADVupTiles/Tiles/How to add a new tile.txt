1. Create a new folder inside the Tiles folder for your tile.
2. Build the html, js, css as you like.
3. Open the Tiles\Tiles.js file and create a definition for the tile. Just copy paste one of the tiles and change the name, color, script url etc. 
4. Then at the top of the tiles.js, find the window.DefaultTiles = { ... } and place the new tile where you want it to appear.

That's it!
