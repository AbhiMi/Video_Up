Refactoring and new features
==================

1. Remove all UI jobs from the model classes.
	* Dashboard.js subscribes to change notification of all section and tile.
	* Dashboard.js hooks into each tile for .click behavior. 
	* When tiles change, check if the tile has UI behavior hooked. If not hook.
	* AppStore.js similarly hooks into changes in object model and puts .click behavior on them.
